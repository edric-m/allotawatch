    <string name="section_content_about">
        This app is a time management tool and multitasking app that lets you track how you spend
        your time. The app can also track your time on break. It can be used for short term
        goals like cooking or workouts as well as tracking long term goals or projects.
        Adding timers is quick and simple and switching between them only requires swiping the screen.
        The apps planning feature lets you list what you need to have completed and lets you
        divide your time between those tasks over a long period of time. This way you can set your
        goals first, and then try to meet them.\n\n

        The app was inspired by an article from waitbutwhy.com that highlights how limited and valuable
        our time is. When we subtract our sleep, time for loved ones, and leisure, there is very limited
        time left for work. The app will help in ensuring you put it the time needed for work and
        effectively use it so that you can have a healthy balance of work, leisure, and rest.\n\n

        Being able to quickly switch between tasks was added to allow having a flexible and reactive
        schedule instead of a rigid one. I am unable to focus on a single task for too long and my
        productiveness drops, I find that it helps to switch to another task that I want to complete
        to refresh myself as well as stay productive.\n\n

        Other features that aid productiveness are,\n
            \t- parallel alarms for off the cuff alarms,\n
            \t- notifications on how long a break has been going for,\n
            \t- task information like overall time spent doing something as well as time since your last break,\n
            \t- notifications for when you\'ve met your time investment goal, and\n
            \t- the ability to control the app from a notification icon.\n\n
