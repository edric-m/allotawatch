        its a time management tool. (and multitasking app)
        lets you track how you spend your time.
        the app can also track your break time
        easy to use for short term goals and long term
        short term because timers are easy to add and switch between tasks
        its flexible and even has a quick timer function for off the cuff alarms
        its mainly designed for long term goals because of the budgeting functionality
        long term because you can plan your time for the next two weeks. you list what you have to do
        then divide the time you have among those tasks.
        It was inspired by an article from waitbutwhy.com that highlights how limited our time is\n
        It allows you to switch between tasks freely and still be sure you are properly investing
        the amount of time that you have.
        made because i got bored doing one thing for too long
        by planning you can switch tasks whenever you want and be confident you are putting the
        correct amount of time into what you want to accomplish and not waste any time
        (it lets you accomplish multiple things and not waste any time)
        (so you plan what you want to accomplish in a day and switch between them when you get tired of
        one task. because we need to step away from something once in a while and refresh ourselves by switching
        to something else productive.) Switching like this allows you to have a flexible and reactive schedule
        as opposed to a rigid one.
        The app also shows you the overall amount of time that youve spent on a task as wel as how long
        since your last break and how long youve been on a break for

        with this app you set the time for your goals first, then try to meet them
